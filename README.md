## 📚 Libraries Covered

This project helps you learn the following Python libraries:

### 🐍 NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for **numerical computing** in Python—enabling efficient array operations and mathematical functions.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 📊 Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that allows you to create **2D visualizations** like bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, histograms, and more.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 🧾 Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for **data manipulation and analysis**. It offers DataFrame structures for handling tabular data easily.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
